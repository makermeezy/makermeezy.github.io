I am accepting commission requests or inquiries at makermeezy@gmail.com. If you are interested in any of the
black paper pad pieces on my social media pages, you can order an upscaled digital print or a reproduction
on black canvas (which will be more pricey). At this point, the largest size I will be printing/creating 
is 16" x 20".
